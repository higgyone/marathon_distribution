# marathon_distribution
This code is to find the distribution type, mean and standard deviation times for the Manchester 2022 marathon for different age and gender categories.

The code shows it is probably a Weibull distribution, which is a subset of GEV.

For MV45 age results are:
Weibull distribution
mean MV45 = 03:54:43
std dev MV45 = 00:46:13
time at 1 std dev MV45 = 03:08:30
