# marathon_distribution
This code is to find the distribution type, mean and standard deviation times for the Manchester 2022 marathon for different age and gender categories.

The code shows it is probably a Weibull distribution, which is a subset of GEV.

For MV45 age results are:</br>
Weibull distribution </br>
mean MV45 = 03:54:43</br>
std dev MV45 = 00:46:13</br>
time at 1 std dev MV45 = 03:08:30</br>


Note the code is rough and more of a  trying new things to get to the result. It needs a lot of tidying up and removing of redundant comments and bits that didn't work. They are kept in in case I need to refer to them another time.

There will be no more work on this repo
